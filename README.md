# Wulf Forge: Wulfram 2 Server Emulator
* Download client: https://download.cnet.com/wulfram-ii/3000-2119_4-10077757.html
* Download the source code for Wulf-Forge: https://github.com/baffler/Wulf-Forge/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
* Install the client and extract Wulf-Forge where best convenient

# To get the server running
* Install python (I've tested with Python 3.12)
* Go to the directory where you extracted Wulf-Forge
* Open a terminal and run `python main.py`

# Make Wulfram 2 connect to the server
* You'll need to pass a couple of parameters to get it working
* You can run wulfram2.exe with command arguments `-root -windowed`
* The simpliest way to do this is to create a text file alongside the exe (wherever you installed Wulfram 2)
* Put `-root -windowed` into the text file, then save it as `launch.w2l`
* It should associate the .w2l file with Wulfram and  you can just double click to launch the game now
* Alternatively you can create a text file in the directory and put the arguments on each line:

```
-root
-windowed
```

* Save it as `_override_args` (No file extension)
* Then you can just launch the wulfram exe and it will let you connect to the local server

# History
(From the Facebook group)

The best free game which refuses to die. As of October 2010, Slurpy-the Divine One-has resurrected the game once again. And sometime in 2011, the game went down again. Shit.
Wulfram 2 is(was) a multiplayer online-game involving strategy, skill, and vulching; vulching is the best. It peaked around 2001-2002, when seeing over forty-five people in each server was fairly common. Wulfram lagged and lagged to a point where players were lucky to get in a game of three on three as other prominent online games emerged(and since America legalized Absynthe). Sometime in November 2009 the website and game finally went down, effectively terminating the addictions of the last few dedicated fans. Most of the community have moved on to better things including alcohol, women, and Xbox Live. But here in this group you will find a core understanding and respect of what use to be one of the most exciting, amusing-let us not forget aggravating-online experiences to have ever existed: Wulfram II.
